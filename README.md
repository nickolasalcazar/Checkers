# Online Checkers

A browser-based, online-multiplayer Checkers game made using Express.js and [WebSockets](https://www.npmjs.com/package/websocket). The app implements a stateful, server-authoritative model, where the state of a game is stored in the server. The design of the app aims to be simple and stateful.

Play the game **[here](https://play-checkers-online.herokuapp.com/)**.

## Credit

This project is a fork of [Ryan Branco](https://github.com/RyanBranco)'s repo "[Checkers](https://github.com/RyanBranco/Checkers)". Branco's repo is credited for the underlying logic of the checkers app. I programmed the game's online functionality and added additional styling.
